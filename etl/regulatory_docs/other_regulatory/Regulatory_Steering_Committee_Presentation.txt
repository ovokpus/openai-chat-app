==================================================
SLIDE 5: KEY CHALLENGES & RISKS
==================================================
Title: Implementation Challenges and Risk Mitigation

High Priority Issues:
1. Data Quality - Subsidiaries Consolidation
   Risk: Incorrect consolidation scope affecting capital calculations
   Mitigation: Enhanced data validation rules and manual verification
   Timeline: Resolution by Q1 2025

2. Model Validation Delays
   Risk: IRB models not approved before go-live
   Mitigation: Parallel run with standardised approach as fallback
   Timeline: Supervisory approval expected Q2 2025

3. System Integration Testing
   Risk: End-to-end testing incomplete for market risk
   Mitigation: Extended UAT period and additional test scenarios
   Timeline: Completion by January 15, 2025

Medium Priority:
• Staff training completion: 85% (target 95%)
• Documentation updates pending for 3 procedures
• Regulatory change monitoring process enhancement

==================================================
SLIDE 6: EBA STRESS TESTING RESULTS
==================================================
Title: 2024 EBA Stress Test Results Summary

Adverse Scenario Impact:
• CET1 Ratio Baseline (2024): 13.2%
• CET1 Ratio Adverse (2026): 9.8%
• Minimum CET1 Ratio during stress: 9.1% (2025)

Key Findings:
• Bank maintains CET1 above regulatory minimum throughout stress period
• Credit losses primarily driven by corporate portfolio deterioration
• Market risk impact limited due to conservative trading book
• Operational risk losses within expected ranges

Management Actions Available:
- Dividend restriction capability: €2.1B capital preservation
- Business growth constraint: €800M capital savings
- Capital instrument issuance: €1.5B AT1 capacity

==================================================
SLIDE 7: DATA LINEAGE & GOVERNANCE
==================================================
Title: Data Governance and Lineage Enhancement

Source Systems Integration:
• Core Banking System (CBS): ✓ INTEGRATED
• Market Risk System (MUREX): ✓ INTEGRATED  
• General Ledger (SAP): ✓ INTEGRATED
• Treasury Management System: ⚠ TESTING
• Subsidiaries Reporting: ⚠ DATA QUALITY ISSUES

Data Quality Metrics:
• Completeness: 98.5% (target: 99.0%)
• Accuracy: 97.2% (target: 99.5%)
• Timeliness: 99.1% (target: 99.0%)
• Consistency: 96.8% (target: 98.0%)

Critical Data Flows:
1. CBS → DWH → Regulatory Reporting: Daily reconciliation
