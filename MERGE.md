git commit -m "Rollback deployment changes"
git push origin main
```

## 📞 **Post-Merge Actions**

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Changes should auto-deploy, or trigger manual deployment
2. **Test Production**: Verify all functionality works in production

4. **Monitor**: Check Vercel function logs for any runtime errors

## 🎯 **What Should Work After Merge**

- ✅ Vercel deployment succeeds 
- ✅ Frontend loads without 404 errors
- ✅ Math formulas render correctly (KaTeX fonts)
- ✅ API endpoints accessible
- ✅ File uploads work
- ✅ Chat functionality operational
