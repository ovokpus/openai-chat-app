# RAG Pipeline Fix - Merge Instructions

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved!**

The RAG pipeline was not working because the system was storing and retrieving prompt objects instead of actual document content. This has been **completely fixed**.

## 🛠️ **Changes Made**

### Core Fixes:
1. **Fixed ChatOpenAI.run()** - Now properly handles RolePrompt objects using `create_message()` method
2. **Fixed VectorDatabase** - Removed automatic embedding model creation without API key
3. **Enhanced session management** - Better API key handling and embedding model initialization
4. **Added comprehensive error handling** - Better debugging and error messages

### Files Modified:
- `aimakerspace/openai_utils/chatmodel.py` - Fixed prompt object handling
- `aimakerspace/vectordatabase.py` - Improved embedding model management  
- `aimakerspace/rag_pipeline.py` - Added debug logging and better error handling
- `api/app.py` - Enhanced session and embedding model management

## 🚀 **How to Use the Fixed System**

### Step 1: Clear Old Sessions (Important!)
The old sessions contained corrupted data. They've been cleared automatically, but if you encounter issues:

```bash
# Check for sessions
curl http://localhost:8000/api/sessions

# Delete any problematic sessions
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/session/SESSION_ID_HERE
```

### Step 2: Upload a New Document
1. Go to your frontend application
2. Upload a PDF document 
3. Wait for the upload to complete successfully

### Step 3: Test RAG Functionality
1. Turn ON RAG mode in the frontend
2. Ask questions about your uploaded document
3. You should now get relevant, document-based responses!

### Example Test Questions:
- "What is this document about?"
- "Summarize the main points"
- "What are the key topics covered?"

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### The Root Cause:
The `ChatOpenAI.run()` method was checking for `message.content` but RolePrompt objects store content in `message.prompt`. This caused the system to pass the string representation of prompt objects to the LLM instead of the actual document content.

### The Fix:
```python
# Before (broken)
if hasattr(message, 'role') and hasattr(message, 'content'):
    # This failed for RolePrompt objects

# After (fixed)  
if hasattr(message, 'create_message'):
    formatted_messages.append(message.create_message())
elif hasattr(message, 'role') and hasattr(message, 'prompt'):
    formatted_messages.append({
        "role": message.role,
        "content": message.prompt
    })
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

The system has been thoroughly tested with:
- ✅ Vector database storage and retrieval
- ✅ Text splitting and chunking
- ✅ Embedding generation and search
- ✅ Context formatting
- ✅ Prompt object handling
- ✅ End-to-end RAG pipeline

## 🎉 **Success!**

After merging, your RAG system will:
- ✅ Properly process uploaded PDFs
- ✅ Store document content (not prompt objects)
- ✅ Retrieve relevant information for user queries
- ✅ Generate accurate, document-based responses
- ✅ Handle API keys and sessions correctly

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check sessions**: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/sessions`
2. **Upload a fresh document** (old sessions may still have issues)
3. **Verify API key** is valid and has proper permissions
4. **Check backend logs** for any error messages

The RAG pipeline is now fully functional! 🚀
