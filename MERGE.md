# Merge Instructions for Feature Branch: regulatory-reporting-copilot

## Overview
This branch contains comprehensive enhancements to the OpenAI Chat App with RAG capabilities, focusing on regulatory reporting assistance and copilot functionality.

## What's Changed

### 📚 ETL Preprocessing System (Major Enhancement)
- **New ETL Directory**: Created `etl/` with regulatory documents and preprocessing scripts
- **Document Preprocessing**: All 25MB+ regulatory documents converted to 1.7MB JSON format
- **Vercel Optimization**: Reduced API directory size by 92% (25MB → 1.9MB) for faster deployments
- **Knowledge Base Sources**: 
  - Basel III documents (927 chunks)
  - FINREP Templates (337 chunks)
  - COREP Templates (135 chunks)
  - Other Regulatory docs (284 chunks)
  - **Total**: 1,683 chunks from 9 regulatory documents

### 🔧 Infrastructure Fixes
- **Vercel Configuration**: Modernized from deprecated "builds" to functions/rewrites
- **Deployment Optimization**: Fixed Vercel 250MB function size limit issues
- **Path Resolution**: Added multiple fallback locations for file access
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced debugging and error messages

### 📄 Document Management Enhancements
- **Global Knowledge Base**: Centralized document management for all users
- **File Persistence**: User uploads saved to organized `uploaded_docs/` folder
- **Multi-format Support**: Enhanced processing for various document types
- **Automatic Refresh**: Knowledge base updates after upload/delete operations

### 🗑️ **Delete Functionality Fix (Latest)**
- **Fixed API Route Mismatch**: Frontend now correctly calls `/api/documents/` (plural) instead of `/api/document/` (singular)
- **Complete File Removal**: Delete operations now remove both:
  - Document chunks from vector database
  - Physical files from `uploaded_docs/` folder
  - Tracking entries from in-memory lists
- **Timestamp Handling**: Properly finds and deletes timestamped files (e.g., `20250702_131150_filename.pptx`) based on original filenames
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if physical file deletion fails, continuing with vector database cleanup

### 🎯 RAG Pipeline Improvements
- **Regulatory Enhancement**: Specialized RAG enhancer for regulatory content
- **Chunking Optimization**: 800-character chunks for better context
- **Performance**: Instant knowledge base initialization from preprocessed data
- **Scalability**: ETL approach supports adding new documents without redeployment

## Technical Details

### File Organization
```
├── etl/                          # ETL processing (development only)
│   ├── regulatory_docs/          # Original documents (25MB+)
│   ├── preprocess_knowledge_base.py
│   └── README.md
├── api/services/
│   ├── preprocessed_knowledge_base.json  # Deployment asset (1.7MB)
│   └── knowledge_base/
│       └── uploaded_docs/        # User uploads with timestamps
└── frontend/src/services/
    └── chatApi.ts                # Fixed delete endpoint URL
```

### Delete Functionality Flow
1. **Frontend Request**: `/api/documents/{filename}` with API key
2. **Backend Validation**: Check if document exists in user_uploaded_documents list
3. **Physical File Removal**: Find timestamped file in uploaded_docs/ folder
4. **Vector Database Cleanup**: Remove all chunks with matching filename metadata
5. **Memory Updates**: Remove from tracking lists and update references
6. **Response**: Success confirmation with updated document counts
