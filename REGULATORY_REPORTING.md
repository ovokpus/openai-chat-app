# 🏦 Reg-Reporting Copilot: RAG for Basel III & Beyond

> **Transform your document chaos into regulatory compliance superpowers** 🚀

Welcome to the most exciting regulatory reporting tool you never knew you needed! This RAG-powered copilot turns thousands of pages of Basel III, COREP/FINREP templates, and scattered ETL documentation into your personal compliance assistant that can quote exactly which paragraph, cell, or SQL snippet it pulled from.

---

## 💡 The Big Idea: **"Reg-Reporting Copilot"**

*A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that helps banks prepare COREP / FINREP / Basel III reports, answer ad-hoc regulator questions, and track delivery status—while quoting the exact paragraph, slide or spreadsheet cell it pulled from.*

### 🎯 Why This Actually Matters

| 😭 Pain Today | 🎉 How RAG Copilot Helps | 👤 Primary User |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Thousands of pages of Basel III, CRR3 and EBA ITS updates every year | Ask "What changed in IRRBB templates v3.3 vs v3.2?" → instant diff with citations | Regulatory-reporting analyst |
| Data lineage & transformation logic scattered across run-books, SQL, Excel "mapping sheets" | "Which source table drives FINREP F 18.00 row 120?" → shows the exact ETL spec & SQL snippet | Data engineer |
| Programme managers need weekly status across dozens of Jira epics | "Summarise open CRR3 items still **amber**" → returns a table grouped by owner & due date | Project manager |

Banks already experiment with RAG for compliance workloads because it provides traceable answers without putting sensitive data into model weights. ([lumenova.ai](https://www.lumenova.ai/blog/ai-finance-retrieval-augmented-generation/), [revvence.com](https://revvence.com/blog/rag-in-banking))

## 📚 What We're Ingesting (Beyond Just PDFs)

| Format | Typical Content | Parser / Notes |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **PDF** (existing) | Basel III, EBA ITS, national guidance notes | Keep page numbers for trust |
| **DOCX** | Previous regulator Q&A letters, policy memos | `python-docx` preserves comments |
| **Excel / CSV** | COREP / FINREP templates; data-mapping sheets | Load with `pandas`, convert each sheet or row to Markdown before embedding |
| **SQL / YAML / Terraform** | ETL logic and infra-as-code for reporting stack | Chunk by statement; tag `lang=sql` |
| **PowerPoint** | Steering-committee decks with timelines | `python-pptx`; each slide a chunk with speaker notes |
| **Jira / Azure Boards JSON** | Epics, stories, risk logs | Nightly export → embed each ticket with `status`, `owner` metadata |

💡 **Pro Tip**: Add a metadata flag `audience: analyst | engineer | pm` at ingest time to let retrieval prioritise the right chunks.

## 🔍 Smart Retrieval & Generation Features

### 1. 🎯 Hybrid Search Magic
- **BM25 boost** on cell/row IDs (`F18.00_120`) and issue keys (`RPT-123`) so precise queries hit first
- **Embedding search** for natural-language questions ("interest-rate risk buffer floor")

### 2. 🎭 Persona-Aware Routing
Toggle your role and get tailored results:

- **🔬 Analyst** → prefer regulation PDFs & policy memos
- **⚙️ Engineer** → prefer SQL / mapping sheets  
- **📊 PM** → prefer Jira tickets & PPT timelines

### 3. 🎨 Smart Answer Formats
- **Analyst**: Numbered bullet answer + direct quotes
- **Engineer**: Code fences + table lineage diagram
- **PM**: Markdown table *(issue • owner • status • target date)* plus "Copy to PowerPoint" button

---

## 🖥️ UI Vision (Slack/Teams Integration)

| Area | 🔬 Analyst View | 📊 PM View |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Prompt hints** | "Explain CRR3 output-floor calculation." | "Give me % complete by workstream." |
| **Answer pane** | Rich quotes + page links | Progress bar + risk table |
| **Source sidebar** | Collapsible tree: *Basel III (pdf)* / *ITS (2023-03)* | Collapsible tree: *Jira* / *Decks* / *Templates* |
| **Export buttons** | "Generate formal response letter (DOCX)" | "Export status slide (PPTX)" |

A top-right persona toggle switches layouts without re-querying. Clean. Simple. Powerful.
