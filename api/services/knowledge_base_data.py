Introduction 
1. This document sets out the Basel Committee’s finalisation of the Basel III framework. It 
complements the initial phase of Basel III reforms previously finalised by the Committee. The Basel III 
framework is a central element of the Basel Committee’s response to the global financial crisis. It addresses 
a number of shortcomings with the pre-crisis regulatory framework and provides a regulatory foundation 
for a resilient banking system that supports the real economy.

academics, analysts and market participants – lost faith in banks’ reported risk-weighted capital ratios. The 
Committee’s own empirical analyses highlighted a worrying degree of variability in the calculation of RWAs 
by banks.  
3. A prudent and credible calculation of RWAs is an integral element of the risk -weighted capital 
framework. Banks’ reported risk-weighted capital ratios should be sufficiently transparent and comparable 
to permit stakeholders to assess their risk profile.  The Committee’s strategic review of the regulatory

approaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks’ capital

Committee is firmly committed to its mandate of strengthening the regulation, supervision and practices 
of banks worldwide, with the purpose of enhancing financial stability . A banking system that is resilient 
will be able to support the real economy and contribute positively to sustainable economic growth over

Standardised approach for credit risk 
Introduction 
1. The Committee permits banks to choose between two broad methodologies for calculating their 
risk-based capital requirements for credit risk. The first, the standardised approach, assigns standardised 
risk weights to exposures as described in paragraphs 4 to 97.  To determine  the risk weights in the 
standardised approach for certain exposure classes, in jurisdictions that allow the use of external ratings 
for regulatory purposes, banks may, as a starting point, use assessments by external  credit assessment 
institutions that are recognised as eligible for capital purposes by national supervisors, in accordance with 
paragraphs 98 to 116. Under the standardised approach, exposures s""",

to 735 of the Basel II framework (June 2006), banks must perform due diligence to ensure that they have 
an adequate understanding, at origination and thereafter on a regular basis (at least annually), of the risk 
profile and characteristics of their counterparties. In cases where ratings are used, due diligence is

some or all of the following characteristics, either in legal form or economic substance:  
• The exposure is not related to real estate and is within the definitions of object financ e, project

Internal ratings-based approach for credit risk 
A. Overview  
1.  This section describes the IRB approach for credit risk. Subject to certain minimum conditions 
and disclosure requirements, banks that have received supervisory approval to use the IRB approach may 
rely on their own internal estimates of risk components in determining the capital requirement for a given 
exposure. The risk components include measures of the probability of default (PD), loss given default 
(LGD), the exposure at default (EAD), and effective maturity (M). In some cases, banks may be required to 
use a supervisory value as opposed to an internal estimate for one or more of the risk components.  
2. The IRB approach is based on measures of unexpected losses (U""",

separately, as outlined in paragraph 43 of the Basel II framework (June 2006)1 and Section G below.  
3. In this section, the asset classes are defined first. Adoption of the IRB approach across asset 
classes is also discussed early in this section. The risk components, each of which is defined later in this

6. The classification of exposures in this way is broadly consistent with established bank practice. 
However, some banks may use different definitions in their internal risk management and measurement 
systems. While it is not the intention of the Committee to require banks to change the way in which they 
manage their business and risks, banks are required to apply the appropriate treatment to each exposure 
for the purposes of deriving their minim um capital requirement. Banks must demonstrate to supervisors 
that their methodology for assigning exposures to different classes is appropriate and consistent over 
time.

Minimum capital requirements for CVA risk  
A. General provisions 
1. In the context of this document, CVA stands for credit valuation adjustment specified at a 
counterparty level. CVA reflects the adjustment of default risk -free prices of derivatives and securities  
financing transactions (SFTs) as defined in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Annex 4 of the Basel II framework 1 due 
to a potential default of the counterparty. Regulatory CVA may differ from CVA used for accounting 
purposes as follows: (i) regulatory CVA excludes the effect of the bank’s own default; (ii) several constraints 
reflecting best practice in accounting CVA are imposed on calculations of regulatory CVA, so some banks 
may find that regulatory CVA deviates from their acco""",

2. CVA risk is defined as the risk of losses arising from changing CVA values in response to changes 
in counterparty credit spreads and market risk factors that drive prices of derivative transactions and SFTs.  
3. The capital requirement for CVA risk must be calculated by all banks involved in covered

The CVA portfolio includes CVA for a bank’s entire po rtfolio of covered transactions and eligible CVA

5. Two approaches are available for calculating CVA capital: the standardised approach (SA -CVA) 
and the basic approach (BA -CVA). Banks must use the BA -CVA unless they receive approval from their

Output floor 
Introduction 
1. To reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets and to enhance the comparability of risk-
weighted capital ratios, banks will be subject to a floor requirement that is applied to risk-weighted assets. 
The output floor will ensure that banks’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of 
capital requirements derived under standardised approaches. 
Output floor requirements 
2. As set out in the Basel III framework, banks must meet the following capital requirements:  
• Common Equity Tier 1 must be at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets at all times. 
• Tier 1 capital must be at least 6.0% of risk-weighted assets at all times. 
• Total Capital (Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital) must""",

Leverage ratio 
Introduction  
1. An underlying cause of the global financial crisis was the build -up of excessive on - and off-
balance sheet leverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive leverage while 
reporting strong risk-based capital ratios. At the height of the crisis, financial markets forced the banking 
sector to reduce its leverage in a manner that amplified downward pressures on asset prices. This 
deleveraging process exacerbated the feedback loop between losses, falling bank capital and contracting 
credit availability.  
2. The Basel III framework introduced a simple, transparent, non-risk-based leverage ratio to act as 
a credible supplementary measure to the risk-based capital requirements.1 The""",

processes that can damage the broader financial system and the economy; and 
• reinforce the risk-based requirements with a simple, non-risk-based “backstop” measure.  
3. The Committee is of the view that a simple leverage ratio framework is critical and complementary

Exposure measure 
20. The leverage ratio exposure measure generally follows gross accounting values.

guarantees or other credit risk mitigation techniques to reduce the leverage ratio exposure measure, nor

(In this paper, “outsourcing” is limited to the initial transfer of a function from a regulated entity to a service provider. Further transfers of a function (or a part of that function) from one third-party service provider to another are referred to herein as “subcontracting.” In this connection, please note that in some jurisdictions, the initial outsourcing is also referred to as subcontracting.) |  |  |  |  |  |  |
