The Basel III \nframework is a central element of the Basel Committee’s response to the global financial crisis. It addresses \na number of shortcomings with the pre-crisis regulatory framework and provides a regulatory foundation \nfor a resilient banking system that supports the real economy. \n2.

To determine  the risk weights in the \nstandardised approach for certain exposure classes, in jurisdictions that allow the use of external ratings \nfor regulatory purposes, banks may, as a starting point, use assessments by external  credit assessment \ninstitutions that are recognised as eligible for capital purposes by national supervisors, in accordance with \nparagraphs 98 to 116.

An underlying cause of the global financial crisis was the build -up of excessive on - and off-\nbalance sheet leverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive leverage while \nreporting strong risk-based capital ratios. At the height of the crisis, financial markets forced the banking \nsector to reduce its leverage in a manner that amplified downward pressures on asset prices. This \ndeleveraging process exacerbated the feedback loop between losses, falling bank capital and contracting \ncredit availability.  \n2.
