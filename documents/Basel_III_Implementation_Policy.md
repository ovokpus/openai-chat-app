## 3. Regulatory Framework

### 3.1 Basel III Capital Requirements
The bank must maintain minimum capital ratios as follows:

**Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital:**
- Minimum ratio: 4.5% of total risk-weighted assets
- Capital conservation buffer: 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets
- Combined minimum requirement: 7.0% of total risk-weighted assets

**Tier 1 Capital:**
- Minimum ratio: 6.0% of total risk-weighted assets
- Including capital conservation buffer: 8.5% of total risk-weighted assets

**Total Capital:**
- Minimum ratio: 8.0% of total risk-weighted assets
- Including capital conservation buffer: 10.5% of total risk-weighted assets

### 3.2 Additional Capital Buffers

**Countercyclical Capital Buffer:**
- Applied based on credit exposures by jurisdiction
- Rate determined by national authorities (0% to 2.5%)
- Calculated quarterly based on exposure distribution

**Systemic Risk Buffer:**
- Applied to domestic exposures in designated countries
- Rate varies by jurisdiction and risk assessment
- Updated annually based on regulatory announcements

**Global Systemically Important Institution (G-SII) Buffer:**
- Applied to institutions designated as G-SIIs
- Rate determined by Basel Committee methodology
- Ranges from 1.0% to 3.5% based on systemic importance score

## 4. Capital Components

- Defined benefit pension fund assets

### 4.2 Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Capital

**Qualifying Instruments:**
- Instruments must be issued and fully paid
- Subordinated to depositors and general creditors
- No fixed maturity date (perpetual)
- Callable at issuer's discretion after minimum 5 years
- Contains effective loss absorption mechanism

**Key Features:**
- Principal write-down or conversion to CET1
- Trigger level at 5.125% CET1 ratio
- Discretionary payment of distributions
- No step-up clauses or incentives to redeem

### 4.3 Tier 2 (T2) Capital

**Qualifying Instruments:**
- Subordinated debt instruments
- Minimum original maturity of 5 years
- Recognition limited to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets
- Subject to amortisation in final 5 years

**Provisions:**
- General provisions up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets
- Eligible provisions for IRB institutions
- Excess provisions not recognised in regulatory capital

## 5. Risk-Weighted Assets Calculation

### 5.1 Credit Risk

**Standardised Approach:**
- Sovereign exposures: 0% to 150% risk weights
- Institution exposures: 20% to 150% risk weights
- Corporate exposures: 75% to 150% risk weights
- Retail exposures: 75% risk weight
- Secured by real estate: 35% to 100% risk weights

**Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach:**
- Foundation IRB for corporate, sovereign, and institution exposures
- Advanced IRB for eligible exposure classes
- Own estimates of PD, LGD, EAD, and M parameters
- Subject to supervisory approval and validation

### 5.2 Market Risk

**Standardised Approach:**
- Interest rate risk: Duration-based approach
- Equity position risk: 8% specific risk + general market risk
- Foreign exchange risk: 8% of net open position
- Commodity risk: 15% specific risk + general market risk

**Internal Models Approach:**
- Value-at-Risk (VaR) models subject to regulatory approval
- 99th percentile confidence level over 10-day holding period
- Stressed VaR based on 12-month stressed period
- Incremental risk charge for default and migration risk

### 5.3 Operational Risk

**Basic Indicator Approach:**
- 15% of average gross income over three years
- Simplified calculation for smaller institutions
- Annual gross income components defined in CRR

**Standardised Approach:**
- Business line specific beta factors (12% to 18%)
- Eight business lines as defined in CRR
- Three-year average of gross income by business line

**Advanced Measurement Approaches:**
- Internal operational risk models
- Subject to supervisory approval
- Quantitative and qualitative standards
- Loss data, scenario analysis, business environment factors
